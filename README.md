### 🌟 Affective Computing Deep Learning Framework
### 🎭 Emotion Recognition and 🎶 Music Suggestion via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
### 📌 Project Overview
This project integrates real-time emotion recognition using deep learning (CNN/ResNet50V2) and provides personalized music recommendations based on the detected emotion. The goal is to build an affective computing framework that responds to a user's emotional state using a webcam and recommends appropriate songs from predefined datasets.

### 🧠 Core Features
* 🎥 **Real-Time Emotion Detection** via webcam using CNN (custom/resnet50v2).

* 😃 Emotion classes: **Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised.**

* 🎵 **Dynamic Song Recommendations** from emotion-based CSV song datasets.

* 🧩 **Flask Web App** with live video stream + responsive UI (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).

* 🖼️ Facial feature extraction via **Haarcascade + Keras/TensorFlow prediction.**

* 📊 Fully trained models using the **FER2013 dataset.**

### 💡 Project Motivation
Emotion-aware applications can power the next generation of human-computer interaction. This project combines computer vision, deep learning, and music information retrieval to develop a system that recognizes emotions and responds with music.
